# Description

This is frontend application for university project. It's simple guitar store page.

## Deployment

Application is published on Heroku : https://tai-frontend-shop.herokuapp.com/shop

<b>Important</b> : If you dont see the products in the shop then "wake" the backend by visiting it's URL : https://tai-backend.herokuapp.com/api/products . After loading just go back to shop page. This behavoiur is caused by Free Heroku hosting. Frontend tries to get data from "sleeping" backend. After you hit on backend's URL everything should be fine.
